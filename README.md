```

4- Add the package in your application's **composer.json** autoload section to make it available in your application. 

```

"psr-4": {
            "App\\": "app/",
            "Vendor\\Package\\": "packages/vendor/package/src/Package"

6- Add the newly create package's service provider to your **config/app.php** provider's list.

7- Have fun!

## Package dependencies

Laravel won't autoload the **vendor/** path in your package's development folder. Easiest workaround is to add them in your main application's composer.json.

But also ensure they are in the package json file

##notes
Within the boot method, you may do whatever you like: register event listeners, include a routes file, register filters, or anything else you can imagine.‚Äù

So the register one is just for binding. The boot one is to actually trigger something to happen.
